Step 1: create a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by an `<html>`
Step 2: inside the `<html>`, create a `<head>` and `<body>`
Step 3: add `<title>` within `<head>` and explain its purpose
Step 4: add `<meta>` within `<head>` and set its `charset` attribute to "utf-8"
Step 5: add `<meta>` within `<head>` with `name` and `content`
        attributes set to appropriate values, so that the page looks the same
        on all devices
Step 6: add `<h1>` within `<body>` with the name of the project
Step 7: link a CSS stylesheet to the HTML page
Step 8: style `<h1>`'s `text-align` property to 'center'
Step 9: add a `<div>` with its class set to `container` under `<h1>`
Step 10: within the container `<div>`, add another `<div>` and set its class as
         `marker`
Step 11: add `background-color: red;` to the `.marker` selector
Step 12: set `.marker`'s `height` and `width` to '25px' and '200px' respectively
Step 13: introduce `margin` as the short-hand for `margin-top`, `margin-bottom`,
         `margin-left` and `margin-right`
Step 14: add two more `<div>` with its class set to `container`
Step 15: in the `.container` CSS rule, set `margin` to '10px auto'
Step 16: show how to make a HTML element take multiple classes
Step 17: remove the `background-color` property and its value from the `.marker`
         CSS rule
Step 18: create a new CSS rule that targets the class `one` and set its
         `background-color` property to 'red'
Step 19: add classes `two` and `three` to the respective `<div>`s
Step 20: create two CSS rules `.two` and `.three` and set their
         `background-color` to 'green' and 'blue' respectively
Step 21: introduce two colour models and the CSS `rgb` function
Step 22: explain what a function is and how rgb colour works
Step 23: use the `rgb()` to create green and blue colours for the `.two` and
         `.three` CSS rules
Step 24: in the `.two` CSS rule, set the green value in the `rgb()` to '127'
         to lower its intensity
Step 25: in the `.container` CSS rule, use the `padding` property to add '10px'
         of top and bottom padding, and set the left and right padding to '0'
Step 26: introduce primary colours in the RGB colour model
Step 27: in the `.container` rule, set the red, green and blue values to the
         max of '255'
Step 28: introduce secondary colours in the RGB colour model
Step 29: mix pure green and pure blue to create the cyan colour using `rgb()` in 
         the `.two` CSS rule
Step 30: mix pure red and pure blue to create the magenta colour using `rgb()`
         in the `.three` CSS rule
Step 31: introduce tertiary colours in the RGB colour model
Step 32: mix green and cyan to create spring green using `rgb()` in the `.two`
         CSS rule
Step 33: mix magenta and blue to create violet using `rgb()` in the `.three` CSS
         rule
Step 34: create chartreuse green, azure and rose colours in the `.one`, `.two`
         and `.three` CSS rules respectively
Step 35: set the `background-color` of `.one`, `.two` and `.three` CSS rules
         to pure black using `rgb()`
Step 36: introduce the concepts of hues (similar colours) and complementary
         colours in a colour wheel
Step 37: introduce the practice of choosing one colour as dominant colour, and
         its complementary colour as an accent to bring attention to certain
         content on the page
Step 38: set the `background-color` to black and red in the `.one` and `.two`
         CSS rules respectively
Step 39: set the `background-color` to black in the `.two` CSS rule
Step 40: remove the `background-color` property and value in the `h1` CSS rule
Step 41: in the first marker `<div>`, change the class `one` to `red`
Step 42: update the `.one` CSS rule to target the `red` class
Step 43: update `rgb()` in the `.red` CSS rule so that the red value is at the
         max
Step 44: change the class `two` and `three` to `green` and `blue` in their
         respective colour marker `<div>`
Step 45: 

Summary of lesson learned:
1. "utf-8" is a universal character set that includes almost every character
   from all human languages.
2. A HTML element can take multiple classes, however the styles of the first
   class in the list can be overridden by later classes.
