Step 1: create a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by an `<html>`
Step 2: inside the `<html>`, create a `<head>` and `<body>`
Step 3: add `<title>` within `<head>` and explain its purpose
Step 4: add `<meta>` within `<head>` and set its `charset` attribute to "utf-8"
Step 5: add `<meta>` within `<head>` with `name` and `content`
        attributes set to appropriate values, so that the page looks the same
        on all devices
Step 6: add `<h1>` within `<body>` with the name of the project
Step 7: link a CSS stylesheet to the HTML page
Step 8: style `<h1>`'s `text-align` property to 'center'
Step 9: add a `<div>` with its class set to `container` under `<h1>`
Step 10: within the container `<div>`, add another `<div>` and set its class as
         `marker`
Step 11: add `background-color: red;` to the `.marker` selector
Step 12: set `.marker`'s `height` and `width` to '25px' and '200px' respectively
Step 13: introduce `margin` as the short-hand for `margin-top`, `margin-bottom`,
         `margin-left` and `margin-right`
Step 14: add two more `<div>` with its class set to `container`
Step 15: in the `.container` CSS rule, set `margin` to '10px auto'
Step 16: show how to make a HTML element take multiple classes
Step 17: remove the `background-color` property and its value from the `.marker`
         CSS rule
Step 18: create a new CSS rule that targets the class `one` and set its
         `background-color` property to 'red'
Step 19:         

Summary of lesson learned:
1. "utf-8" is a universal character set that includes almost every character
   from all human languages.
2. A HTML element can take multiple classes, however the styles of the first
   class in the list can be overridden by later classes.
