7. wrap the previous `<h1>` and `<p>` in a `<div>` (with `label` class)
8. target `.label` and set its `border` to appropriate values
9. set `.label`'s `width` to an appropriate value to create white space around
   the label
10. set the `margin` and `padding` attributes of the `.label` to appropriate
    values
11. set all elements' `box-sizing` property to "border-box" in order to include
    padding and border to their sizes

14. set `h1`'s `margin` to appropriate values
15. remove all margins of `p`

    appropriate values
18. introduce `letter-spacing` CSS property
19. give the second `<p>` a class of "bold"
20. create a `.bold` selector, set its `font-weight` to an appropriate value,
    and remove the `font-weight` declaration from the `h1` ruleset
