Step 1: prepare the basic structure to start building a web page. Add
        `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<html>`
Step 2: add `<head>` and `<title>`
Step 3: explain the purposes of `<title>` and `<meta>` (with `charset`
        attribute)
Step 4: add `<body>`
Step 5: add `<main>` within `<body>`
Step 6: add `<h1>` within `<main>`
Step 7: add `<p>` that contains year of establishment
Step 8: add `<section>` to hold coffees
Step 9: add `<h2>` in the coffee `<section>`
Step 10: introduce `<style>` element (one of the many ways to style a HTML page)
Step 11: how to style an element and introduce `text-align` CSS property
Step 12: introduce CSS *type selector* and centre a couple of elements
Step 13: introduce applying the same group of CSS styles to a comma-separated
         list of selectors
Step 14: introduce good CSS styling practice: create a css file and put all the
         styles in it
Step 15: remove the `<style>` and all its content
Step 16: introduce `<link>` element and use it to link a stylesheet to a HTML
         page
Step 17: add a `<meta>` to make the styling of the page looks similar on
         desktop or mobile
Step 18: introduce `background-color` property and style `<body>`
Step 19: style `<body>`'s `background-color` as `burlywood`
Step 20: introduce `<div>` element and its purpose
Step 21: introduce `width` CSS property
Step 22: how to add comments or comment out codes in CSS
Step 23: set the `background-color` of `<div>` to `burlywood`
Step 24: set the `width` of `<div>` to `80%`, making it 80% the width of its 
         parent element `<body>`
Step 25: introduce `margin-left` and `margin-right` CSS properties, and use
         them to centre the `<div>`
Step 26: introduce CSS *class selector* and change `div` type selector to
         `.menu`
Step 27: apply `.menu`'s styling to the `<div>` by assigning the value `menu`
         to its `class` attribute
Step 28: introduce `background-image` CSS property and use an image of coffee
         beans for the background of the page
Step 29: introduce `<article>` element
Step 30: nest two `<p>` inside the `<article>` for drink and price
Step 31: add four more `<article>` blocks for coffee flavours and their prices
Step 32: add `flavor` class to the "French Vanilla" `<p>`
Step 33: introduce `text-align` CSS property and set `.flavor`'s `text-align`
         property to `left`
Step 34: add `price` class to the `<p>` where French Vanilla's price is placed
Step 35: set `.price`'s `text-align` property to `right` in the stylesheet
Step 36: add `item` class to the `<article>` that wraps up the French Vanilla
         information
Step 37: introduce *descendant selector*, `display` CSS property and a `display`
         value `inline-block` which makes block elements behave like inline
         elements
Step 38: set the `width` property of both `.flavor` and `.price` to `50%` in the
         stylesheet
Step 39: set the `width` property of both `.flavor` and `.price` to `49%` in the
         stylesheet instead
Step 40: move the coffee `<p>` and price `<p>` next to each other with no space
         between them
Step 41: set the `width` property of both `.flavor` and `.price` back to `50%` 
         in the stylesheet again
Step 42: add the `.item` class to other `<article>` elements
Step 43: put the other `<p>` elements to be on the same line with no space
         between them
Step 44: add applicable classes `.flavor` and `.price` to all the remaining
         `<p>` elements
Step 45: change `.flavor` class `width` value to `75%`, `.price` class `width`
         value to `25%`
Step 46: add a second `<section>` for displaying desserts offered by the cafe
Step 47: add a `<h2>` in the new section and give it the text "Desserts"
Step 48: add a `<article>` with `item` class under the heading
Step 49: add two `<p>` sitting next to each other inside the `<article>`
Step 50: add `dessert` as the value of the first `<p>`'s class, `price` as the
         value of the second `<p>`'s class
Step 51: now make `.flavor` and `.dessert` share the same CSS rule by using
         a comma
Step 52: add three more dessert `<article>` as it is placed above
Step 53: introduce `padding-left` and `padding-right` CSS properties
Step 54: introduce `padding-top` and `padding-bottom` CSS properties
Step 55: introduce `padding` as the short-hand CSS property for `padding-top`,
         `padding-bottom`, `padding-left` and `padding-right`
Step 56: introduce `max-width` CSS property as a way to prevent an element
         from growing too large as the screen size expands
Step 57:

Summary of lesson learned:
1. HTML elements: `<style>`, `<link>`, `<div>`, `<article>`
2. CSS properties: `text-align`, `background-color`, `width`, `margin-left`,
`margin-right`, `background-image`, `text-align`, `display`, `padding-left`,
`padding-right`, `padding-top`, `padding-bottom`, `padding`, `max-width`,
3. `display: inline-block;` makes block elements behave like inline elements.
4. Multiple selectors can share the same CSS rule in a comma-separated selector
   list.
5.
