## Walkthrough

Step 1: set up boilerplate code by adding `DOCTYPE` declaration, `<html>` (with

Step 3: add `<title>` and `<link>` (for adding CSS to the page)
Step 4: (now turn to `<body>`) add `<header>` (with a `header` class) and nest

        `<img>` inside it
Step 6: fill the `<img>` with links to cat photos
Step 7: in the stylesheet, target `.gallery` and `<img>` and set their `width`,
