# Rothko Painting Project (CSS Box Model)

Step 1: set up the HTML page with `DOCTYPE` declaration, `<html>` (set to
        English), `<head>` and `<body>`
Step 2: set up the character encoding (hint: `<meta>` and `charset="UTF-8"`) for
        the HTML page, and add `<title>` in `<head>` and `<img>` in `<body>`
Step 3: explain the content part of the CSS box model
Step 4: explain the padding and border parts of the CSS box model
Step 5: explain the margin part of the CSS box model
Step 6: add a `<div>` that serves as a canvas
Step 7: link a stylesheet to the HTML page
Step 8: write a CSS rule that targets the `.canvas` class selector and set its
        width to an appropriate value
Step 9: add `height: 600px;` to the CSS rule
Step 10: add `background-color: #4d0f00;` to the CSS rule
Step 11: wrap a `<div>` with a `frame` class over the canvas `<div>`
Step 12: write a CSS rule that targets `.frame` and define its `border` property
Step 13: in the same rule, set the `width` property to '500px', same as that of
         `.canvas`
Step 14: set `.frame`'s `padding` to '50px' to add some space between the frame
         and the canvas
Step 15: use the `margin` property to centre the frame (and the nested canvas)
         horizontally
Step 16: nest a new `<div>` (with class `one`) inside the canvas `<div>`
Step 17: write a new CSS rule that targets `.one` and its `width` property
Step 18: set the `height` property for `.one`
Step 19: set the `background-color` property for `.one`
Step 20: use the `margin` shorthand to centre the `.one` element horizontally
Step 21: add `padding` of 1px to the `.canvas` element so as to give the `.one`
         element something solid to push from
Step 22: replace the `padding` property with `overflow` (set to 'hidden') in
         the `.canvas` rule
Step 23: add another `<div>` with class `two` below the `one` `<div>`
Step 24: set the `width` property for the `.two` CSS rule
Step 25: set the `height` property for the `.two` CSS rule
Step 26: set the `background-color` property for the `.two` CSS rule
Step 27: set the `margin` property for the `.two` CSS rule to centre the box
Step 28: nest a new `<div>` (with class `three`) inside the canvas `<div>`
Step 29: create a `.three` CSS rule and set its `width` property using
         percentage
Step 30: set the `height` property for the `.three` CSS rule using percentage
Step 31: set the `background-color` property for the `.three` CSS rule
Step 32: centre the `.three` element using the `margin` property
Step 33: use the `margin` shorthand property to set `.two` element's top,
         horizontal, bottom margins to '0', 'auto' and '20px' respectively
Step 34: introduce a new CSS property `filter` and CSS `blur()`
Step 35: target both `.one` and `.two` and increase their blur effect by '1px'
Step 36: increase the `blur()` of `.three` by '2px'
Step 37: increase the area and soften the edges of `.one` by setting its
         `box-shadow` to appropriate values
Step 38: add the same code to `.two`, but with a different colour value
Step 39: increase the area and soften the edges of `.three` by setting its
         `box-shadow` to appropriate values
Step 40: introduce the `border-radius` CSS property
Step 41: use the `border-radius` shorthand to set the values for two pairs of
         diagonally opposed corners of the `.two` element
Step 42:

Summary of lesson learned:

1. New CSS properties learned: `filter`, `border-radius`,
2. New CSS functions learned: `blur()`,
