Step 1: create a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration to begin the project
Step 2: add a `<html>` with an `lang` attribute set to "en"; below the
        declaration
Step 3: add a `<head>` and `<body>` inside the `<html>`
Step 4: add a `<meta>` with a `charset` attribute set to "UTF-8" and a title of
        'Registration Form' (`<title>`)
Step 5: add `<link>` inside `<head>` to link a CSS stylesheet (styles.css) to
        the HTML page
Step 6: add `<h1>` within the `<body>`
Step 7: below `<h1>` heading, add a `<p>` with text to encourage users to
        register
Step 8: introduce `vh` unit for CSS styling and the concept of viewport
Step 9: set the `margin` of `<body>` to '0' to remove the horizontal scroll bar
Step 10: set the `background-color` and `color` on `<body>` to specified values
Step 11:

Summary of lesson learned:
1. CSS units: `vh`
2. It's a good practice to set the `margin` of `<body>` to 0 because some
   browsers add some margin by default.
